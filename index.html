          The principal members of the Beatles were John Lennon, Paul McCartney,
          George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. Other early members included Stuart
          Sutcliffe and Pete Best.

          The Beatles were formed around the nucleus of members John Lennon and
          Paul McCartney, who first performed together in Liverpool, England, in
          1957. They performed with a changing cast of accompanists and under a
          changing list of band names before settling on their final members and
          name.

          Beatlemania was the name given to the popular frenzy surrounding the
          Beatles after the band's first appearances on British television in
          1963. When the Beatles appeared on American television in 1964,
          Beatlemania also erupted in the United States. Mass media created the
          conditions for the collective frenzy that was Beatlemania.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Beatles' first hit was the song “Love Me Do” in 1962, which peaked
          at number 17 on the U.K. singles charts. The song was released by the
          record label Parlophone but had been recorded before the band was
          signed.

        <p>
          The Beatles formally disbanded in the spring of 1970. All four members
          went on to produce more music individually or with other groups.
